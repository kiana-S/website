# tokinanpa.dev

This repository contains the configuration and maintainance scripts for my
personal website.

The site is hosted on a personal web server with:

- NixOS operating system
- Nginx web server
- Static site generated with Hakyll

## Inspiration

The structure of this config is heavily inspired by
[this blog post](https://bradparker.com/posts/deploying-a-fully-automated-nix-based-static-website)
written by Brad Parker, based on [his own website](https://github.com/bradparker/bradparker.com/).
